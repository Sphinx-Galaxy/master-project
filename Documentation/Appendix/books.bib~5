@inproceedings{ai-dlr-survey,
	abstract = {The possibilities to observe and interact with any
given spacecraft are naturally limited compared to groundbased systems due to a number of factors. These include but are
not limited to the availability and bandwidth of their connection
to ground, the availability of staff, communication latencies and
power budgets.
While a minimum level of autonomy is required for every spacecraft, past experiments and missions have shown that introducing more sophisticated autonomy mechanisms can drastically
increase the efficiency for many missions in terms of reliability,
science output and required operational effort.
Artificial intelligence poses an increasingly popular approach
for implementing on-board autonomy. The number of techniques and variants of artificial intelligence available in the
literature is, however, just as diversified as their potential field
of application. To provide an overview of the current state
of the art of artificial intelligence and its application for space
systems, this paper provides an extensive survey on existing
techniques and algorithms as well as existing and potential
applications on board spacecraft and on ground. The survey
focuses on autonomous planning and scheduling of operations,
self-awareness, anomaly detection and Fault Detection Isolation
and Recovery (FDIR), on-board data analysis as well as onboard operations and processing of earth-observation data.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes to use autoencoders with nonlinear dimensionality reduction in the anomaly detection task. The authors apply dimensionality reduction by using an autoencoder onto both artificial data and real data, and compare it with linear PCA and kernel PCA to clarify its property. The artificial data is generated from Lorenz system, and the real data is the spacecrafts' telemetry data. This paper demonstrates that autoencoders are able to detect subtle anomalies which linear PCA fails. Also, autoencoders can increase their accuracy by extending them to denoising autoenconders. Moreover, autoencoders can be useful as nonlinear techniques without complex computation as kernel PCA requires. Finaly, the authors examine the learned features in the hidden layer of autoencoders, and present that autoencoders learn the normal state properly and activate differently with anomalous input.},

The features are designed so that the inner products of the transformed data are approximately equal to those in the feature space of a user specified shift-invariant kernel. We explore two sets of random features, provide convergence bounds on their ability to approximate various radial basis kernels, and show that in large-scale classification and regression tasks linear machine learning algorithms applied to these features outperform state-of-the-art large-scale kernel machines.},

@inproceedings{auto-enc-2,
	abstract = {Deep autoencoders, and other deep neural networks, have demonstrated their effectiveness in discovering non-linear features across many problem domains. However, in many real-world problems, large outliers and pervasive noise are commonplace, and one may not have access to clean training data as required by standard deep denoising autoencoders. Herein, we demonstrate novel extensions to deep autoencoders which not only maintain a deep autoencoders' ability to discover high quality, non-linear features but can also eliminate outliers and noise without access to any clean training data. Our model is inspired by Robust Principal Component Analysis, and we split the input data X into two parts, $X = L_{D} + S$, where $L_{D}$ can be effectively reconstructed by a deep autoencoder and $S$ contains the outliers and noise in the original data X. Since such splitting increases the robustness of standard deep autoencoders, we name our model a "Robust Deep Autoencoder (RDA)". Further, we present generalizations of our results to grouped sparsity norms which allow one to distinguish random anomalies from other types of structured corruptions, such as a collection of features being corrupted across many instances or a collection of instances having more corruptions than their fellows. Such "Group Robust Deep Autoencoders (GRDA)" give rise to novel anomaly detection approaches whose superior performance we demonstrate on a selection of benchmark problems.},
